# Frontend Troubleshooting

## Session P&L tile loses negative sign

**Symptom:** When session P&L is negative (e.g. -$20.00), the stats tile in the
Trading page shows `$20.00` instead of `-$20.00`. Color still indicates a loss but
the sign is absent.

**Root cause:** The `formatUSD` helper uses `Math.abs` internally so it always
returns a positive string. The stats tile passed the raw value directly without
adding a sign prefix.

**Fix:** `TradingView.tsx` — stats tile value expression now prepends `-` for
negative P&L: `stats.totalPnl < -0.005 ? '-' + formatUSD(totalPnl) : formatUSD(totalPnl)`.
Positive values intentionally omit `+` to stay visually distinct from the `+$x`
format used in trade-row cells (avoids duplicate-text test ambiguity).

**Regression test:** `frontend/src/test/components/TradeFeed.test.tsx` — component
render suite; the unique sign format prevents `getByText(/\+\$x/)` matching both
the tile and the trade row.

## Win-rate shows 0% when server returns empty summary

**Symptom:** When `/dashboard/performance-trends` returns a zero summary
(`win_rate: 0`, `total_trades: 0`) before any trades are graded, the Win Rate tile
shows `0%` even though `tradeFeed` already contains closed fills with computable PnL.

**Root cause:** The fallback condition only checked `win_rate != null`; a genuine
`0` from an empty summary is not null so the fallback computation was skipped.

**Fix:** `TradingView.tsx` — condition now also requires `total_trades > 0`:
`performanceSummary?.win_rate != null && (performanceSummary?.total_trades ?? 0) > 0`.
When both `win_rate` and `total_trades` are 0, the client computes win rate from
the local `tradeFeed` array instead.

**Regression test:** `frontend/src/test/components/TradeFeed.test.tsx` — verify
win rate shows computed value when summary has zero trades.

## In-memory positions show `unrealized_pnl: 0.0` for active shorts

**Symptom:** In memory-fallback mode, open short positions could appear with
`unrealized_pnl: 0.0` (or stale) even when `last_price` and `avg_cost` clearly
imply non-zero P&L.

**Root cause:** Quantity sign conventions were mixed across memory paths.
Some writers persisted short qty as negative while the in-memory paired-PnL
calculator expected strictly positive qty and treated `qty <= 0` as invalid.
That incorrectly marked valid short rows as stale and excluded their unrealized
P&L from summary totals.

**Fix:** `api/in_memory_store.py` now normalizes open-position magnitude with
`abs(qty)` before applying side-aware formulas:

- long: `(last_price - avg_cost) * qty`
- short: `(avg_cost - last_price) * qty`

Rows are marked stale only when price/cost inputs are missing or malformed, not
because short qty is negative.

**Regression tests:**

- `tests/core/test_in_memory_unrealized_pnl.py::test_unrealized_pnl_long_and_short_and_missing_price`
- `tests/core/test_in_memory_unrealized_pnl.py::test_unrealized_pnl_short_with_negative_qty_uses_absolute_position_size`

**Prevention guidance:** Keep unrealized-PnL math centralized in
`InMemoryStore.paired_pnl_payload()` and avoid re-implementing qty-sign logic in
routes/services. Any new writer that mutates memory positions must preserve
`side` and `qty` consistently and include a memory-mode regression test.

## REST hydration overwrites WS orders with wrong `side` value

**Symptom:** Orders hydrated via `GET /dashboard/state` appear with `side: "buy"`
or `side: "sell"` instead of `"long"`/`"short"`, breaking order panel and
equity curve components that compare against the `'long' | 'short'` union.

**Root cause:** The backend `orders` array uses `OrderSide` values (`"buy"`, `"sell"`).
The WS `trade_fill` path in `_handleTradeNotification` already normalizes these to
`"long"`/`"short"`, but `hydrateDashboard` spread REST orders directly without the
same normalization step.

**Fix:** `useCodexStore.ts` `hydrateDashboard` — map each REST order through a
`normSide` helper (`sell`→`short`, `short`→`short`, `buy`→`long`, `long`→`long`)
before merging into the store.

**Regression test:** `frontend/src/test/store/hydrate-dashboard.test.ts` —
`hydrateDashboard — orders side normalization` suite.

## REST hydration drops WS-sourced positions for symbols not in REST top-N

**Symptom:** In memory-fallback mode (or when positions exceed REST page size),
positions that arrived via WS `dashboard_update` events vanish when a REST hydration
fires, because `hydrateDashboard` replaced `positions` wholesale.

**Root cause:** `hydrateDashboard` did a full overwrite: `updates.positions = data.positions`.
Any WS-sourced position for a symbol absent from the REST response was silently discarded.

**Fix:** `useCodexStore.ts` `hydrateDashboard` — merge by symbol. REST positions are
authoritative for symbols they cover; positions for symbols absent from the REST response
are preserved from existing WS state. An empty REST array is treated as "no data" (no-op).

**Regression test:** `frontend/src/test/store/hydrate-dashboard.test.ts` —
`hydrateDashboard — positions merge` suite.

## Dashboard shows "unreachable" error state during transient REST failure when WS is live

**Symptom:** A brief backend hiccup sets `systemFeedError = "Dashboard API unreachable"`.
The error banner persists even though the WebSocket remains healthy and is streaming
live updates. Dashboard status indicator shows `error` instead of the true `Healthy`.

**Root cause:** `useRestPoll.ts` set `systemFeedError` unconditionally on any fetch
exception, including when `wsConnected=true`. It also continued polling `/dashboard/state`
every 30 s after WS connected, risking stale REST values overwriting fresher WS state.

**Fix:** `useRestPoll.ts` — `systemFeedError` is only set when `!wsConnected`. The
REST dashboard/prices interval is not installed when WS is up; a single hydration fetch
runs on WS connect instead.

**Regression test:** No automated test (React hook interval logic); verified by
checking that `POLL_SLOW_MS` branch is unreachable when `wsConnected=true`.

## Notifications tile showed the capped backlog (200) as if it were new activity

**Symptom:** On a freshly opened dashboard the Agents page "Notifications" tile
read `200` even though nothing had just happened and the feed looked idle. The
number never reflected "what's happening now".

**Root cause:** The tile rendered `notifications.length`. The store hydrates the
Redis `notifications:recent` backlog and caps it at 200 (`useCodexStore`), so the
length is the stored-history size, not recent activity — it pins at 200 on any
established session.

**Fix:** `components/dashboard/agents/AgentsDashboard.tsx` now shows
`countRecentNotifications(notifications, 1h)` as the headline ("Notifications · 1h")
with `N stored (max 200)` and the last-activity time as secondary context. The
recent-count + last-activity helpers live in `frontend/src/lib/notification-metrics.ts`.

**Regression test:** `frontend/src/test/helpers/notification-metrics.test.ts` —
`countRecentNotifications` counts only in-window items, not the full backlog.

## RECENT DECISIONS stat line read like a broken total (last-hour next to all-time)

**Symptom:** The Agents page "Recent Decisions" header showed
`Buys: 0  Sells: 0  Holds: 14  Total: 500`. Operators read it as one tally and
reported the count as wrong/corrupt — `0 + 0 + 14` plainly does not equal `500`.

**Root cause:** The breakdown figures and the total come from *different time
windows* but were rendered side by side with no labels. In
`api/services/redis_store.py::decision_stats`, `buys`/`sells`/`holds` count only
decisions newer than `now - 3600` (last hour), while `total` is the length of
the whole `decisions:recent` list (LTRIM-capped at 500). An established session
pins `total` at the 500 cap regardless of recent activity, so the two figures
are unrelated and were never meant to sum.

**Fix:** `components/dashboard/RecentDecisionsPanel.tsx` now labels the windows
explicitly — a `last 1h` tag in front of Buys/Sells/Holds and an `all-time` tag
(plus a hover title noting the 500 cap and that it won't equal
Buys + Sells + Holds) in front of Total. No data/API change; the figures were
already correct, only the presentation was ambiguous.

**Regression test:** `frontend/src/test/components/RecentDecisionsPanel.test.tsx`
— `labels the last-hour breakdown and the all-time total as distinct windows`.

## Scattered `as Record<string, unknown>` casts — fragile dynamic-field reads

**Symptom:** A static UI audit flagged ~13 sites in `TradingView.tsx` reading
dynamic agent-log / position fields via `(x as Record<string, unknown>)?.field`.
Not crashing (optional chaining guarded them), but fragile and repetitive: each
cast skips runtime validation, and a non-object value reaching a deeper
`...?.data?.symbol` access could throw.

**Root cause:** `agentLogs` / `positions` from `useCodexStore()` are typed
narrowly, so every alias field (`confidence_score`, `source`, `data.symbol`,
`decision`, `qty` vs `quantity`, `created_at`) required an inline cast. The
pattern was copy-pasted rather than centralized.

**Fix:** two pure helpers in `src/lib/formatters.ts` —
- `getField(obj, key)`: returns `undefined` unless `obj` is a plain object with
  that key (safe on null/array/primitive),
- `getStr(obj, ...keys)`: first present alias coalesced to a string, else `''`.

All 13 casts in `TradingView.tsx` replaced with these. One canonical, tested
accessor instead of scattered unchecked casts. `LearningLoopPanel.fmtUSD` also
hardened to render `--` for null/NaN, and `AgentStatusTable` empty-row `colSpan`
now uses `COLUMNS.length` instead of a hardcoded `5`.

**Regression test:** `frontend/src/test/helpers/formatters.test.ts` —
`getField` / `getStr` describe blocks (null/array/primitive safety, alias
coalescing, stringification).
